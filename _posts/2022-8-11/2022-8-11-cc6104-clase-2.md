## Introduction to Statistical Thinking

- Statistical thinking is a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the **world** and use **data** to make decisions and predictions.

- This is done taking into account the inherent **uncertainty** that exists in the real world.  [^1]

- The foundations of statistical thinking come primarily from mathematics and statistics, but also from computer science, psychology, and other fields of study. [^2]
