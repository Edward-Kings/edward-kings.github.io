Primer laboratorio.

The goal of the lab is to help motivate the course by giving you some challenging tasks/questions to solve on the Web. Along with the solution, for each question you answer, please also provide a brief summary of how you found the answer; the summary should be enough to repeat what you did, including links to web-pages with the key info, how these web-pages were found, combined, etc). If you think the page might change or not be available any more during the evaluation of the lab, please include a screenshot. For the purposes of this lab, you can trust the information you find on arbitrary webpages that were not published by you or someone you know :).
